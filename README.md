#Resistor dispener

this is the first prototype of a resitor dispenser that i'm designing, it's designed to make it easier to choose and take resitor for your project

the design is made to give an easy way to storage your resistor, along with an interchangable sign to recognize the value of the resistors

everytime you need to take a resistor you only have to take it from the lower part of the dispenser and when you've finished with it you can just drop it on the hole on top of it
